Passwordgenerator - (minimal) Rework

I did this some years ago and wasn't well programmed, it's still not, but it works.
Only the Passwordgenerator.exe file is reqired for running.

Types of Passwords:
	- letters, numbers and all common special charcters
	- only letters and numbers
	- letters, numbers and by the user choosen special characters


Hints:
	A ganerated password can be copied from the 'All Passwords' list, to the clipboard, via right mouse button and clicking the copy button (Ctrl + C doesn't work).
	Clicking left on a password will copy it to the "Selected Password" field and won't be affected by the clear list action. From there it can be copied right mouse button and Ctrl + C.
